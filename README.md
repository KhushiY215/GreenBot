## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Many plant owners struggle to keep track of their plantâ€™s needs â€” watering schedules, sunlight exposure, soil health, and pest issues.  
This repo contains a responsive static website that showcases the product concept, UI flows, and mock interactions for features such as **CropGuard** (disease detection UI), **CropHelp** (soil-based crop recommendations), and a **Blog** area.
